This project started in late 2021 when I first learned js/html. It was originally supposed to be a standard incremental game that I would develop to learn js.

In early 2022, I decided to refactor the entire game and add various features. In 2023, I decided to archive this to github and this is where it lies abandoned today.

This ancient relic includes many *great* code features such as:
 - Inconsistent naming patterns
 - Unnecessary object/class boilerplate
 - No module system
   - 75% of the code is in [a single file](./docs/js/game.js) that is 1300 lines long
 - No type system
 - ~~"Recycled" code~~
 - Many other bad coding practices
